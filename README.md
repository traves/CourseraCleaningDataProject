Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==================================================

This repo contains my solution to the course project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data, taught by Jeff Leek. The course project required us to merge datasets and then manipulate the merged data to create a tidy dataset. My tidy dataset is attached as TidyData.txt. The file codebook.md contains a description of the original datasets, the merged dataset and the tidy dataset. The file run_analysis.R is a heavily commented R script that can be used to reproduce the TidyData.txt file. Please see this file for a detailed description of what the code is doing. The run_analysis.R file should be run while the working directory is set to a copy of the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset folder. See the comments in the run_analysis.R file for information on how to set the working directory. 

Any comments are welcome and should be directed to me by email at traves@usna.edu.
